# Bootstrap Modal Image Gallery
This repository was created for the week 3 mission of Siliconmade Academy and includes the steps of creating a repository on Github, 
configuring a .gitignore file, and cloning the repository to the local machine using the Github Desktop app. It's an exercise in 
creating a simple image gallery using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The gallery displays images in a grid layout, and when 
clicked, each image opens in a large modal window.
